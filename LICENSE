this repository contains academic lab work for Geographic Information System.
you are welcome to read the code and learn from it.

copying, submitting, or slightly renaming this code
for assignments, labs, exams, or evaluations is strictly
not allowed and may result in academic dishonesty.

and yes... i will be disappointed. VERY.
you’re better than this. i hope.

if this code looks tempting to submit:
close the tab. open ARCmap. and struggle like the rest of us.

remember: the real learning happens when you write it yourself.  
may your geoprocessing be error-free and your maps make sense on the first try :)
