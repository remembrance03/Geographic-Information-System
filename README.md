# Geographic-Information-System

This repository contains the work of smriti's practical GIS assignment aimed at evaluating core competencies in spatial data handling and GIS analysis using ArcGIS.

The assignment focuses on applying standard GIS workflows to a selected district and municipality of Nepal, integrating spatial and population data, assessing spatial accuracy, and producing meaningful thematic maps.

## Objectives
The primary objectives of this assignment are to:
1. Manage and organize spatial datasets effectively
2. Perform GIS analysis using ArcGIS tools
3. Integrate population and attribute data with spatial layers
4. Assess spatial accuracy and data consistency
5. Produce clear, meaningful maps following cartographic standards
6. Document GIS workflows through structured reporting
